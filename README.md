#### Design
I approached this project with the idea of having the look of a traditional child board game. Happy colors, animations, cartoons, and elementary level math questions. 

#### Get Started 

To get start with this game. Simple click the [Click Here to Start!] button located on the right hand side of the board game/screen. This will then direct your school bus to the first board spot and ask you a math question to start moving through the board. 

#### Next Steps

I would like to make my game a responsive app. I would also like to give the player the options to continue to other maps with high levels of math questions. I also need to add a reset button to restart game and possible a pop up in the beggining of the game to explain the rules and directions of the game to the player.
